Hi I am Anirban Deb Roy. I wear multiple hats in life , some of them being a father, cricketer, yoga enthusiast, programmer. 
I have a passion for developing web application for business as well as for fun during my leisure. 
My primary skills are ReactJS, Redux, javascript, HTML, CSS but I also like to program on backend mainly NodeJS. I have an extensive
experience in many technologies and industry domains and I have a proven record of delivering and bringing real value to a variety of business 
domains which include HealthCare IT, Telecom, Auto Finance.
I am currently learning to use Ionic framework for writing hyrid applications. I am also learning to write more of React Hooks rather than the 
legacy class based style of React programming.
